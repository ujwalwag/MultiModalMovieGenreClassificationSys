# 🎬 Multi-Modal Genre Classification System

This is a Flask-based web application for **multi-label movie genre classification** using both **textual (movie plot)** and **visual (poster image)** inputs. It combines LSTM and ResNet-based models trained on a balanced TMDB dataset across the top 10 genres.

## 🧠 Features

- 🔤 **Text-based Genre Classification** using LSTM and GloVe embeddings (input: movie plot)
- 🖼️ **Image-based Genre Classification** using ResNet-18 (input: movie poster)
- 🔀 Unified **multi-modal predictions** for accurate multi-label genre output
- 🌐 Web interface to enter a plot and/or upload a poster
- 📊 Visual genre probability predictions
- 🐳 Docker support for containerized deployment

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- `pip`
- Git
- torch
- torchvision
- torch
- Docker(for web deployment)

---

### 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ujwalwag/Movie-Genre-Classification-Sys.git
cd ujwalwag/Movie-Genre-Classification-Sys
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🧪 Run Locally

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

---

### 🐳 Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t movie-genre-classifier .
docker run -p 5000:5000 movie-genre-classifier
```

---

### 💡 How to Use

1. Visit the web app.
2. Enter a **movie plot (overview)** to predict based on text.
3. Upload a **poster image** to predict based on movie poster.
4. Click **Predict** to get genre predictions from:
   - The **Text model**, the **Image model**.

## 🧠 Model Overview

### 🔤 Text Model (LSTM)

- Pre-trained **GloVe (100d)** embeddings
- Tokenizer saved in `tokenizer.json`
- BiLSTM → Mean Pooling → Dense layers
- Uses `embedding_matrix.npy`

### 🖼️ Image Model (ResNet-18)

- Based on torchvision’s pretrained ResNet-18
- Final FC layer replaced for 10-class sigmoid output
- Poster inputs are normalized and resized
